# MLR503-Final

This repo contains everything you need to know for the final exam, both the theory and the programming part. We will begin by going over the theory. 

The content that is covered in the final is comprehensive, as follows: 
- Data pre-processing and preparation
- Uninvariate linear regression
- Multivariate linear regression
- Decision trees
- Anomaly detection
- SVMs
-  eXplainable AI
-  Unsupervised learning (PCA, tSNE, feature selection and dimensionality reduction)

- [Original Midterm Exam](https://github.com/DaraVaram/MLR503-Final/blob/main/Exams/My%20solutions/MLR503%20Exam%20I%20Solutions%20(Dara).pdf) \[Solved :heavy_check_mark:\]
- [Makeup Midterm Exam]() \[Solved :heavy_check_mark: (This is very similar to the original anyway)\]

## Notebooks
These are all the notebooks that were used to present things in class. 

## Assignments

## Data Science Challenges
- [Challenge 1]() \[Pending :x:\]
- [Challenge 2]() \[Pending :x:\]

## Other practical things
Exploring different datasets, etc... Prof. mentioned that the final exam will have a time-series aspect to it, so these datasets should relate to that as well.

## Lesson 3 - DATA, CORRELATIONS, PREPROCESSING, AND PREPARATION
The overarching idea: _If you feed garbage data into a model, you will get garbage outputs. This is the motivation for data pre-processing_

**Attribute:** Property or characteristic of an object. This is also known as a _feature_, _input variable_, etc... --> Attributes have **values**, which can be numerical or symbols. We will get into this later.


**Object:** Collection of attributes describe an object in the dataset. This is also known as a _data point_.

# MLR503-Final

This repo contains everything you need to know for the final exam, both the theory and the programming part. We will begin by going over the theory. 

The content that is covered in the final is comprehensive, as follows: 
- Data pre-processing and preparation
- Uninvariate linear regression
- Multivariate linear regression
- Decision trees
- Anomaly detection
- SVMs
-  eXplainable AI
-  Unsupervised learning (PCA, tSNE, feature selection and dimensionality reduction)
